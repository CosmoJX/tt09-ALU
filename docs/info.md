## How it works

This is a 4bit ALU that takes two 4bit inputs and outputs a 8bit result

## How to test

The first input was mapped to input pins 0 - 3 and the second input was mapped to input pins 4 - 7.
The output sum was mapped to output pins 0 - 7.
The opcode was mapped to in-out pin 0 - 3.
The overflow was mapped to in-out pin 7.
The carry_out was mapped to in-out pin 6.
