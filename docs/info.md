## How it works

This is a 4bit adder that takes 4bit inputs and output a 4bit sum and a 1bit carry out.

## How to test

The first input was mapped to input pins 0 - 3 and the second input was mapped to input pins 4 - 7.
The output sum was mapped to output pins 0 - 3 and the output carry out was mapped to output pin 4.
